              <dt>Requires Less Land</dt>
              <dd>
                Agriculture takes up half of the world’s habitable land. However, meat-eaters use far more space than vegetarians. Livestock accounts for about 80% of global agricultural land but produces less than 20% of the world’s calories. Meanwhile, plants continue to supply us with more calories and protein, even though they only take up 23% of habitable land. <br />
                <br />

                As the human population grows, farmers will have to reduce livestock production to make room for people. The world will also have to devote more land to reforestation operations. The more trees there are, the more carbon they’ll be able to store, and, as much carbon livestock emits, every acre of forest counts. </dd>
              <br />

              <dt>Produces Fewer Emissions</dt>
              <dd>Like trees, crops produce oxygen, which is incredibly beneficial to the environment. Animals, however, produce methane, nitrous oxide, and other gasses that pollute the air, warm the earth, and accelerate climate change. Cows are the worst culprit by far, emitting four times more GHGs per calorie than pigs or chickens. Beef also emits 20 times more GHGs per gram of protein than common plant proteins, making crops more beneficial to the environment. <br />
                <br />
                The entire process of producing, packaging, and transporting meat also produces more emissions than it does to process plants. Meat factories use nearly 17% of fossil fuel in the U.S., with energy costs representing their fourth-highest operational cost. Whether they use this energy to light their facilities or grow animal feed, it ultimately burns off as GHGs and ends up in the atmosphere. </dd>
              <br />

              <dt> Minimizes Pollution</dt>
              <dd>Vegetarianism can also minimize non-atmospheric pollution. Since crops don’t require antibiotics and hormones like animals, they typically release fewer pollutants into soils and waterways. Growing feed crops also entails more fertilizers and pesticides than most other crop varieties. Thus, cutting out meat and replacing it with vegetables could effectively minimize chemical use and subsequent pollution.</dd>
              <br />

              <dt>Conserves Water</dt>
              <dd>Today, one in nine people lack access to safe water as farming uses more than 70% of the world’s stores. Most of this water goes towards raising livestock. One pound of meat requires 2,400 gallons, and large pig farms may need as much water as an entire city. Meanwhile, producing one pound of wheat only requires 25 gallons of water. Thus, if the demand for meat were to decrease, the world could conserve water and reallocate it to those who need it most. <br />
              <br />

                Still, vegetarians seeking vegetarian environmental benefits should remain conscious of plant products that may use excessive amounts of water. For example, many vegetarians still enjoy roast coffee, but production may require even more water than chicken or pork. Some plant products like soybeans and rice may also use more water than crops like corn and sugarcane. Therefore, if you’re looking to make the most water-conscious choice, you might have to conduct a bit of research before making your shopping list. </dd>
